# CMSC-495-FinTomCat-App
# FinTomCat-App - Phase I

## Agile Development
- Iterative CLI interface simulates sprint-like interaction
- Modular components ready for future expansion

## Design & Architecture
- Object-Oriented Programming: Each transaction is an object
- Layered design: models, services, and utilities

## Data Structures & Algorithms
- List structure to store transactions
- Search algorithm using list comprehension for category filtering

## Testing
- Unit test included for core logic (balance computation)

## Next Steps
- Add persistent storage (SQLite/JSON)
- Build a web interface (or App if time permits)
